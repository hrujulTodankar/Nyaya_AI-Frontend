# Case Presentation Component Data Structures

This document outlines the prop interfaces and data structures for the four case presentation components in the Nyaya AI Frontend: CaseSummaryCard, LegalRouteCard, TimelineCard, and GlossaryCard. Each component is designed to accept structured API responses as props, ensuring consistent data flow from the backend.

## CaseSummaryCard

Displays case overview, key facts, jurisdiction, confidence level, and summary analysis.

### Prop Interface

```typescript
interface CaseSummaryCardProps {
  caseId: string;
  title: string;
  overview: string;
  keyFacts: string[];
  jurisdiction: string;
  confidence: number; // 0.0 to 1.0
  summaryAnalysis: string;
  dateFiled?: string;
  status?: string;
  parties?: {
    plaintiff?: string;
    defendant?: string;
  };
}
```

### Example Data

```json
{
  "caseId": "CASE-2024-001",
  "title": "Breach of Contract Dispute - Software Development Services",

## Implementation Notes

1. **Confidence Levels**: All components include confidence scores (0.0-1.0) to indicate AI certainty in the analysis.

2. **Jurisdiction Awareness**: Each component includes jurisdiction information to ensure context-appropriate display and terminology.

3. **Extensibility**: Prop interfaces are designed to be extensible, allowing for additional fields as the API evolves.

4. **Type Safety**: Using TypeScript interfaces ensures type safety and better developer experience.

5. **Realistic Data**: Example data is based on actual legal scenarios and Indian legal framework, making it suitable for testing and development.

6. **Modular Design**: Each component focuses on a specific aspect of case presentation, allowing for flexible UI composition.
